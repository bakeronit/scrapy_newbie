**Intro**

The protein sequences from A. digitifera had update but not been updated in zoophytebase. ZoophyteBase provides comphrehensive kegg information of coral A. digitifera. However the web database doesn't fit my purpose of downloading all sequences at once. I found python selenium tools, powerful automates browsers,which does all the clicking for me.
